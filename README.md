# Plant-Disease-detection

## Project Overview
- Trained a CNN model to classify plant leaves from color images.
- Used a subset of the PlantVillage dataset with labeled leaf image categories.
- Split image data into training and validation sets to evaluate performance.
- Visualized sample images and monitored accuracy/loss during training.
- Final Validation Accuracy: **87.94%**
  
## Tech Stack 
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle API
- Google Colab
  
## Dataset
**Source:** PlantVillage Dataset on Kaggle

**Description:** The dataset contains color, grayscale, and segmented images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
